    <p><b>12th Fail is a 2023</b> Indian Hindi-language biographical drama film directed, produced and written by Vidhu
        Vinod
        Chopra. It is based on the 2019 eponymous non-fiction book by Anurag Pathak about Manoj Kumar Sharma, who
        overcame extreme poverty to become an Indian Police Service officer.[4] The film stars Vikrant Massey as Sharma,
        alongside Medha Shankr, Anant V Joshi, Anshumaan Pushkar, and Priyanshu Chatterjee.

        Released theatrically on 27 October 2023, 12th Fail received widespread critical acclaim and emerged as a
        sleeper hit, grossing over ₹69 crore (US$8.3 million) worldwide on a ₹20 crore (US$2.4 million) budget.[3][5][6]
        At the 69th Filmfare Awards, it won five awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor (Critics)
        (Massey).[7] Born in dacoit-infested Chambal, Manoj Kumar Sharma is the son of a clerk. His father, an honest
        man, is suspended for hitting a corrupt officer. Manoj prepares cheat slips for his Class 12 exams, as do all
        his batchmates. The teachers at the local school help students cheat. However, a newly transferred police
        officer, DSP Dushyant Singh, stops cheating at the school. As a result, all the students, including Manoj, fail
        the exam.

        Meanwhile, Manoj's father leaves home to challenge his suspension in the High Court. To support the family,
        Manoj and his brother run a traveling rickshaw. However, his brother is falsely accused of smuggling alcohol
        after hitting the local henchman of the MLA after he tries to get their passengers to travel on a bus. Local
        police officers frame his brother, but Manoj bails him out with the help of DSP Dushyant. When Manoj expresses
        his desire to become an officer like him, Dushyant advises him to "stop cheating".

        One year later, Manoj passes his exams without cheating and pursues a B.A. to become a DSP. His paternal
        grandmother gives him all her savings as he sets out to study in Gwalior, but he loses all his belongings on the
        way to a woman who steals them while he dozes off in the bus he is travelling in. He then comes to know that the
        government has decided to stop the Group I exams for MPPSC for the next three years. This destroys his dream of
        becoming a DSP.</p>

        Malayalam-language Indian film Varavelpu starring Mohanlal and many scenes from another Malayalam film Ee
        Parakkum Thalika. Omkarnathji, the ex-principal of a private school, is fighting a court case against the school
        to get his due provident fund and pension. He later wins the case and the school is ordered to give a part of
        its property as compensation, but there is no money in its funds. And thus Deepak's life gets an addition: a
        bus. Instead of selling it off, acting on his father's advice, he decides to run the bus. While the rest of the
        family members - two sisters: Chhaya and Aprana and their Ghar Jamai husbands Vinayak Agrawal, a Lawyer and U.U.
        Upadhyay are against it. They feel it's a low profile job. Their primary interest is in selling off the huge bus
        and devouring their share of property. But Deepak has immense trust in his father's judgment. Sundar a jolly
        good sweetheart, who is desperately trying for an American Visa, is also an age old friend. He comes in handy
        with initial investments and they establish a company, Chal Chala Chal transport. And so begins the ride of
        their lives. The bus is in a dilapidated condition and much of money is gone for the repairs. It's a
        roller-coaster ride where mishaps are more than the commuters. The bus driver, Basantilal wears thick glasses
        and the conductor Harilal has a sugar factory in his mouth and an eye for cash... adding to it like a cherry on
        the triple-decker pastry- Sunder's enmity with a rat which has eaten his passport. Corruption chases Deepak in
        transport business as well U.U. Upadhyay is a chief vehicle inspector. He tried his level best to harass Deepak
        and extort money, raising troubles. These workers are messing up Deepak's life and business, but he can't raise
        a finger against them, for they are under the cushioned wings of the Union Leader Mr. Singh. Their only relief
        should have been the lovely lady on the bus Payal, but the bus hits her fracturing her leg. Now she is also in
        the vengeance mode, extorting money from Deepak. What saves Deepak from these mad house characters, is his faith
        in his principles and his father's love-acting as the strong backbone in bitter sweet times.</p>
